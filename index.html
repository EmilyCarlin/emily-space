    <h2>Hi, I'm Emily. I'm a designer based in Oakland, CA.</h2>
    <p>At the moment I'm helping folks take control of their financial lives at <a href="ynab.com">YNAB</a> I'm a design manager and I also lead design for the account and transaction experiences on the web, iOS, and Android. </p>

I have an academic background in cognitive science and human-computer interaction.</p>
    <p>Prior to working as a designer, I was a researcher and editor for Sherry Turkle at MIT.</p>
