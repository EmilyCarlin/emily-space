    <p> Hey! I'm Emily. I am a "generalist" product designer. I like to write code and thoughtful interface copy. I also build ergonomic design systems and care a lot about user research. </p>
    <p> Right now, I work at You Need a Budget (YNAB). Our mission is to help people take total control of their money. I love working at YNAB; I believe what we're building is an unequivocal force for good in the world.</p>
