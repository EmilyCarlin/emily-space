      I've been a designer at YNAB for over 5 years. A lifetime, in this biz!
      It's where I've done the best (and most meaningful) work of my career thus
      far, a selection of which is available above.

      Prior to YNAB, I lived in Boston, MA and worked at startups and a design
      consultancy. It's perhaps a bit website-ception to link to an old site on
      a new site, but here is my portfolio circa 2019. While it doesn't have the
      latest and greatest, it still reflects the way I approach the work.

      If nothing else, it's a fun time capsule. When I launched it, it spent a
      few days as the top-voted post on Designer News (RIP).
